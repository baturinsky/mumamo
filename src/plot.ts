So, Detective, what will be my first task as your Assistant?
Hmm hmm hmm yes! See this board? It's so called Evidence Board, also known as the MURDER MAP!
Eeek!
Do not fret. It's mostly harmless. It just helps me to visualise evidence I have and connections between the pieces of it.
Looks messy.
Indeed! And this is where you come into picture. You will help me untangle it. Move pieces around, so strings stop crossing over cards.
Hmm, I guess I can do that. Anything else?
Also, in the end, all cards should be on board, but you can temporarily move them to the sides. That's it.
OK, I think I can do it.

You was a great help last time.
I have just moved some paper around.
And did it splendidly! Now I have another task for you.
Let me guess...
Yes! Another tangled board to untangle.
Will it teach me how to solve cases?
It will teach you to untangle strings!
Sigh... OK.

Aaaand... another board!
At least this time I actually have helped to add some pieces to it.
Yes! Pieces that have added a lot of new strings to untangle!
Yay, I guess.

So. Many. Strings.
Yes. It's all connected. 
Will it make solving it harder or easier?
We'll see. Will it make placing it easier?
We'll see. I'm not sure it's even possible.
